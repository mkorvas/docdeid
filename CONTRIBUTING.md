# Contributing

Thanks for considering making an addition to this project! These contributing guidelines should help make your life easier. 

Before starting, some things to consider:
* For larger features, it would be helpful to get in touch first (through issue/email)
* `docdeid` intends to be a generic and re-usable framework. It's not the right place for very domain- or language-specific features.

## Setting up the environment

See: [docs/environment](https://docdeid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environment.html)

## PR checlist

* Verify that tests are passing
* Verify that tests are updated/added according to changes
* Run the formatters (`make format`)
* Run the linters (`make lint`) and check the output for anything preventable
* Add a section to the changelog
* Add a description to your PR
